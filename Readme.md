It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.


The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.The data is unbalanced.

In this project , I did some preprocessing analyzing for the dataset to better understanding the data.


Then , I build Credit Card Fraud Detection Prediction model, which is Logistic Regression with acuuracy of 0.96
